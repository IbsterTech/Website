Running TeamViewer For The First Time!
</p>
<p class="h-2">
After you've installed TeamViewer, a shortcut icon should be present in the application launcher of your desktop environment. 
<br>
Simply search for teamviewer using its search function or look through the applications list. After clicking the icon, teamviewer should open up.
Sometimes the application launcher does not update properly, and TeamViewer won't be present. 
<br>
In that case logging out and back in again or restarting your computer will usually cause TeamViewer to appear.
